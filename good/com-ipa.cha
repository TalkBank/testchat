*CHI:	Mommy open this ? 620128_621843
%xpho:	əˈmaɪs ɛmˈpʊʃ
%com:	after transcribing the entire file, I realized that pʊʃ and
	similar sounding things might mean "open this ." Things that sound
	like əˈmaɪ or ʊˈmaɪ seem to connote desire roughly, "I want
	Mommy to" or "I want you to" or something like that: this is what
	CHI usually says when he's asking his mom to do something for him .
	I've transcribed it as "Mommy" .
